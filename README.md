# MACD-Based Stock Trading Strategy with Backtesting and Visualization

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)** based trading strategy in Python.  
It demonstrates how to:
- Generate trading signals
- Backtest strategies
- Compare performance with a Buy & Hold benchmark
- Visualize results with professional plots

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Simulation**: Generates sample stock price data (randomized returns).  
- **MACD Calculation**: Computes EMA (12, 26), MACD line, Signal line, and Histogram.  
- **Trading Signals**: Detects Buy/Sell opportunities based on MACD crossover rules.  
- **Backtesting**: Evaluates strategy vs. Buy & Hold with cumulative returns.  
- **Visualization**: Four separate plots for price signals, MACD, histogram, and performance comparison.
